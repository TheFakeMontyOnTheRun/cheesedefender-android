Cheese Defender
======================

Fend off those nasty space rodents! Be the one to keep safe our Gouda and Brie deposits!

In this game, to must fire rockets against the rodents spaceships in order to avoid them to reach out "cheese shield". The more rodents reach the shield, the larger and weaker it grows.

This is a simple and fun arcade game.

This might seem like a strange project - the reason is that this was originally written back in 2011 and slowly updated thru the years.
